# vesti

A transpiler that compiles into LaTeX.

## Why do we need a LaTeX transpiler?

I used to create several documents using LaTeX (or plain TeX but TeX is quite
cumbersome to writeâ€”especially when working with very complex tables or
inserting images). Its markdown-like syntax is also not comfortable to use. For
example, here is a simple LaTeX document:

```tex
% coprime is my custom class. See https://github.com/e0328eric/coprime.
\documentclass[tikz, geometry]{coprime}

\settitle{My First Document}{Sungbae Jeong}{}
\setgeometry{a4paper, margin = 2.5cm}

\begin{document}
\section{Foo}
Hello, World!
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

The code above is a figure using TikZ.

\end{document}
```

What annoys me most when using it is the `\begin` and `\end` blocks. Is there a way to write something much simpler? This question led me to start this project. Currently, the following code is generated into the LaTeX code above (except comments) using vesti:

```
% coprime is my custom class. See https://github.com/e0328eric/coprime.
docclass coprime (tikz, geometry)

\settitle{My First Document}{Sungbae Jeong}{}
\setgeometry{a4paper, margin = 2.5cm}

startdoc

\section{Foo}
Hello, World!
useenv figure [ht] {
    \centering
    useenv tikzpicture {
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,1);
    }
}

The code above is a figure using TikZ.
```

# Installation

## Prerequisites
This project uses the zig version 0.15.2.

## Compilation
If you want to compile with Tectonic backend, just run the following command:

```console
$ zig build --prefix-exe-dir <path to install> -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

If you do not want tectonic backend, then run the following.

```console
$ zig build --prefix-exe-dir <path to install> -Dtectonic=false -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

## Configuration
Vesti has a configuration file. The location of the config file is follows:
- Linux, MacOS: `~/.config/vesti/config.zon`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\vesti\config.zon`

zon file stands for _Zig Object Notation_. Here is the example of `config.zon`.
```zig
.{
    .engine = .tectonic,
    .lua = .{
        .make_log = false,
        .line_limit = 45,
    },
}
```
If some fields are missing, then vesti takes the default values (above example
is the default one).

## Warning
This language is in beta, so breaking changes may occur in the future. Be cautious when using it for large projects.
