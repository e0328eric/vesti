A transpiler that compiles into LaTeX.

## Why do we need a LaTeX transpiler?

I used to create several documents using LaTeX (or plain TeX but TeX is quite
cumbersome to writeâ€”especially when working with very complex tables or
inserting images). Its markdown-like syntax is also not comfortable to use. For
example, here is a simple LaTeX document:

```tex
% coprime is my custom class. See https://github.com/e0328eric/coprime.
\documentclass[tikz, geometry]{coprime}

\settitle{My First Document}{Sungbae Jeong}{}
\setgeometry{a4paper, margin = 2.5cm}

\begin{document}
\section{Foo}
Hello, World!
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

The code above is a figure using TikZ.

\end{document}
```

What annoys me most when using it is the `\begin` and `\end` blocks. Is there a way to write something much simpler? This question led me to start this project. Currently, the following code is generated into the LaTeX code above (except comments) using vesti:

```
% coprime is my custom class. See https://github.com/e0328eric/coprime.
docclass coprime (tikz, geometry)

\settitle{My First Document}{Sungbae Jeong}{}
\setgeometry{a4paper, margin = 2.5cm}

startdoc

\section{Foo}
Hello, World!
useenv figure [ht] {
    \centering
    useenv tikzpicture {
        \draw (0,0) -- (1,1);
    }
}

The code above is a figure using TikZ.
```

# Installation

## Prerequisites
This project uses the latest zig (developer version).
On Windows, TeX Live (or related software) and Julia are required.
On Linux and macOS, `freetype2` and `fontconfig` are additionally required.

## Compilation
First, `JULIA_DIR` should be defined to find julia dll and julia C api header.

If you want to compile with Tectonic backend, just run the following command:

```console
$ zig build --prefix-exe-dir <path to install> -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

If you do not want tectonic backend, then run the following.

```console
$ zig build --prefix-exe-dir <path to install> -Dtectonic=false -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe
```

## Warning
This language is in beta, so breaking changes may occur in the future. Be cautious when using it for large projects.
