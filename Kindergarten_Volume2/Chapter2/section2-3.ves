Now we are ready to define a Lebesgue integration. Everywhere in this section,
$(X,\mu)$ denotes a measure space. We are going to define an integration using a
measure. This section is inspired from \cite{Krylov-diffusion}.

useenv defin [Lebesgue Integration] { \label{defin:2.3.1}
    Let $f:X->\R$ be a function such that one of those Riemann integrations
    $$
        \int_0^oo \mu\{f_+ > t\}dt,\quad
        \int_0^oo \mu\{f_- > t\}dt
    $$
    exists and finite. Then we define a \it{Lebesgue integration}\index{Lebesgue
    integration} respect to
    $\mu$ by
    $$
        \int_X f(x)\mu(dx) := \int_0^oo\mu\{f_+ > t\}dt - \int_0^oo\mu\{f_- >
        t\}dt.
    $$
    If $E\subset X$, then we define
    $$
        \int_E f(x)\mu(dx) := \int_X 1_E(x)f(x)\mu(dx).
    $$

    Sometimes, we use the abbreviation of $\int_E f(x)\mu(dx)$ by $\int_E fd\mu$
    if the variable of which is understood.
}

useenv remark { \label{remark:2.3.2}
    We need to justify \Cref{defin:2.3.1}. For any $0<=s<=t$,
    $$
        \{f_+ > t\} \subset \{f_+ > s\},\quad
        \{f_- > t\} \subset \{f_- > s\}.
    $$
    Since $\mu$ is a measure, $t|->\mu\{f_+ >t\}$ and $t|->\mu\{f_- > t\}$ are
    decreasing functions, so they are Riemann integrable on $[\epsilon,N]$ for
    every $0<\epsilon<N<oo$. Now we are understood Riemann integrations
    described in \Cref{defin:2.3.1} by an improper integral, so
    $$
        \int_0^oo \mu\{f_+ > t\}dt
        = \lim_{\scriptstyle N\uparrow oo\atop\scriptstyle\epsilon\downarrow 0}
        \int_\epsilon^N \mu\{f_+ > t\}dt,
    $$
    and similar for $f_-$.
}

Notice that if $f$ is nonnegative, then $\mu\{f_- > t\}=0$ for every $t>0$.
Thus as we discuss the Riemann integration of $\mu\{f_- > t\}$ in
\Cref{remark:2.3.2}, one can obtain
$$
    \int_X f(x)\mu(dx) = \int_0^oo \mu\{f > t\}dt.
$$

Although we define a Lebesgue integral for arbitrary function $f$, we need some
\lq\lq good\rq\rq\ functions to obtain more useful properties for Lebesgue
integral. Below definition says about what is a \lq\lq good\rq\rq\ function.

useenv defin { \label{defin:measurable-fnt}
    Let $Y$ be a topological space and $f:X->Y$ a function. We say that $f$ is
    \it{$\mu$-measurable}\index{function!$\mu$-measurable} if $f^{-1}[E]$ is
    $\mu$-measurable for every Borel set $E\subset Y$.
}

If $f:X->\R$ is $\mu$-measurable, then clearly both $\{f_+ > t\}$ and $\{f_- >
t\}$ are $\mu$-measurable for every $t>=0$. Therefore we have the following
important facts for Lebesgue integral.

useenv thm { \label{thm:props-of-int}
    useenv enumerate [label = (\roman*)] {
        \item If $f<=g$, then $\int_X fd\mu <= \int_X gd\mu$.
        \item Let $f:X->\R$ be a $\mu$-measurable function. Then
        $$
            ?|\int_X f(x)\mu(dx)|? <= \int_X |f(x)|\mu(dx),
        $$
        \item If $A_1,A_2,...,A_n\in\Mf_\mu$, and $c_1,...,c_n>=0$,
        $$
            \int_X \sum_{j=1}^n c_j1_{A_j}\mu(dx)
            = \sum_{j=1}^n c_j\mu(A_j).
        $$
    }
}

Now we are going to study very important limit theorems.

useenv thm { \label{thm:limit-thms}
    useenv enumerate [label = (\roman*)] {
        \item(Monotone convergence theorem) Let $f$, $f_n$ are $\mu$-measurable
        functions such that $0<=f_1<=f_2<=...<=f$ and $f_n\uparrow f$ as
        $n->oo$, then
        $$
            \lim_{n->oo}\int_X f_n(x)\mu(dx) = \int_X f(x)\mu(dx).
        $$ \index{Monotone convergence theorem}
        \item(Fatou's lemma) Let $f_n$ are nonnegative $\mu$-measurable
        functions. Then
        $$
            \int_X \liminf_{n->oo} f_n(x)\mu(dx) <=
            \liminf_{n->oo}\int_X f_n(x)\mu(dx).
        $$ \index{Fatou's lemma}
        \item(Dominated convergence theorem) Let $f$, $f_n$ are $\mu$-measurable
        functions such that $f_n->f$ as $n->oo$ and $|f_n|<=g$ for some
        $\mu$-measurable function $g$ such that $\int_X g d\mu<oo$. Then
        $$
            \lim_{n->oo}\int_X f_n(x)\mu(dx) = \int_X f(x)\mu(dx).
        $$ \index{Dominated convergence theorem}
    }
}

There is the generalized version of \Cref{thm:limit-thms} (iii).
useenv exec* { \label{exe:generalized-DCT}\index{Generalized DCT}
    Let $f$, $f_n$, $g$, $g_n$ are $\mu$-measurable functions such that
    $f_n->f$, $g_n->g$ as $n->oo$, $|f_n|<=g_n$ for every $n$, and $\int_X
    g_nd\mu -> \int_X gd\mu < oo$ as $n->oo$. Then the below relation holds.
    $$
        \lim_{n->oo}\int_X f_n(x)\mu(dx) = \int_X f(x)\mu(dx).
    $$
