In the basis analysis, one is taught that if $X$ is a metric space and $A$ is a
subset of $X$ then $x\in\overline{A}$ if and only if there is a sequence
$(x_n)_n$ in $A$ that converges to $x$. However, such fact does not hold for
general topological spaces. Actually, several properties of sequences in metric
spaces break when we generalize those in the arbitrary topological spaces.
This makes a reason introducing an object which acts like a sequence more
general sense. There are two things that generalize sequences: filters, and nets.
In here, we are going to study about filters. Net theory is introduced in the
appendix.

First, we need to see what are filters. Note that filters are defined even if
$X$ has no topology.
useenv defin [Definition of filters] {
    Let $X$ be a nonempty set. A {\itshape filter} $\Fc$ is a nonempty
    collection of some subsets of $X$ satisfies the following conditions.
    useenv enumerate [label = (\roman*)] {
        \item $\emptyset\notin\Fc$;
        \item If $A\in\Fc$, then $B\in\Fc$ for every $B\supset A$;
        \item If $A,B\in\Fc$, then $A\cap B\in\Fc$.
    }
}
Clearly $\{X\}$ is a filter in $X$, so there exists a filter for any $X$.
In addition, $\{X\}$ is the smallest filter we can ever make. Then, is there
exists a maximal filter in $X$ with respect to the set theoretical inclusion?
Below proposition shows that indeed such filter exists, so this proposition
justifies that \cref{defin:1.2.3} is well-defined.

useenv prop { \label{prop:1.2.2}
    Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $\Fc$ be a filter in $X$. Then there exists a maximal
    filter $\Uc\supset\Fc$ in $X$ meaning that there is no filter $\Gc$ in $X$
    which contains $\Uc$.
    \proof
    Fix a filter $\Fc$ in $X$ and define an ordered set
    $$
        \Cs := \{\Bc \supset \Fc : \Bc \text{ is a filter in } X\}
    $$
    with an inclusion order. Then by the Hausdorff maximal theorem, there exists
    a maximal total ordered subset $\Ds$ of $\Cs$. Claim that $\bigcup\Ds$ is a
    filter and $\bigcup\Ds\supset\Fc$. Notice that the second one is trivial, so
    we are going to focus the first assertion.

    Clearly $\emptyset\notin\bigcup\Ds$ and if $E\in\bigcup\Ds$ and $F\supset
    E$, then $F\in\bigcup\Ds$. If $E_1,E_2\in\bigcup\Ds$, we can two filters
    $\Fc_1,\Fc_2\in\Ds$ such that $E_1\in\Fc_1$ and $E_2\in\Fc_2$, respectively.
    Since $\Ds$ is a chain, it suffices to assume that $\Fc_1\subset\Fc_2$. In
    this case, we have $E_1\cap E_2\in\Fc_2\subset\bigcup\Ds$, proving that
    $\bigcup\Ds$ is a filter.

    Notice that $\bigcup\Ds\in\Cs$ so $\bigcup\Ds$ is the desired one, otherwise
    we can take a filter $\Gc\supset\bigcup\Ds$ but this makes a contradiction
    of the maximality of $\Ds$. \proved
}
useenv defin [Definition of ultrafilters] { \label{defin:1.2.3}
    Let $X$ be a set. An {\itshape ultrafilter} $\Uc$ in $X$ is a maximal
    filter.
}

As we know that such definition is quite difficult to draw some image what
ultrafilters look like. There is a equivalent statement that describes
ultrafilters.

useenv prop { \label{prop:1.2.4}
    Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $\Uc$ be a filter in $X$. Then $\Uc$ is an ultrafilter
    if and only if for any $A\subset X$, either $A$ or $X\setminus A$ belongs to $\Uc$.
    \proof
    To prove the necessity, assume that there exists a subset $A\subset X$
    such that both $A$ and $X\setminus A$ are not in $\Uc$. Then the collection
    $$
        \Uc' := \Uc \cup \{A\cap E : E\in\Uc\}
    $$
    is a filter which contains $\Uc$ by \Cref{exec:1.2.5}. This makes a
    contradiction because $\Uc$ is an ultrafilter.

    Conversely, suppose that $\Uc$ is a filter which satisfies the property in
    above. If $\Uc$ is not maximal, then there exists an ultrafilter
    $\Uc'\supset \Uc$ by \Cref{prop:1.2.4}. We are going to finish the proof
    by showing that $\Uc=\Uc'$.

    Fix $A\in\Uc'$. By the property of $\Uc$, either $A$ or $X\setminus A$ is contained
    in $\Uc$. In here, if $X\setminus A\in\Uc$ then since $\Uc\subset\Uc'$, we have
    $X\setminus A\in\Uc'$ hence
    $$
        \emptyset = A\cap(X\setminus A) \in \Uc'
    $$
    because $\Uc'$ is a filter, but this is nonsense. This derives to have
    $A\in\Uc$, therefore $\Uc'\subset\Uc$. This finishes the proof. \proved
}

useenv exec* { \label{exec:1.2.5}
    Prove that the collection $\Uc'$ defined in \Cref{prop:1.2.4} is a filter.
}

\begin{remark}
    If $\Uc$ is an ultrafilter in $X$ for some nonempty set $X$, clearly both
    $A$ and $X\setminus A$ do not lie in $\Uc$ for any $A\subset X$, otherwise by the
    definition of the filter,
    \[
        \emptyset = A\cap(X\setminus A) \in \Uc,
    \]
    which is a contradiction.
\end{remark}

We have learned what is a filter and what is an ultrafilter. To deal with
filters, we need to know how we can make some appropriate filter.
If $X$ be a nonempty set and $\Cc$ a some collection of subsets of $X$, then we
can generate a filter $\Fc$ in $X$ which contains $\Cc$.

\begin{defin}[Finite intersection property]
    Let $X$ be a set. A collection $\Cc$ of subsets of $X$ has a
    \it{finite intersection property} if for any finite set $\Fc\subset\Cc$,
    the intersection $\bigcap\Fc$ is not empty.
    We also use the abbriviation FIP for the term \lq\lq finite intersection
    property\rq\rq.
\end{defin}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:1.2.7}
    Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $\Cc$ a collection of subsets of $X$ that has
    FIP. Then there exists a filter $\Fc\supset\Cc$ in $X$.
    \proof
    We can find one of such filter explicitly:
    \[
        \Fc = \left\{ E\subset X : E\supset \bigcap\Dc,\;\Dc \text{ a finite subset of }
        \Cc\right\}.
    \]
    Since $\Cc$ has FIP, the emptyset does not contained in $\Fc$.
    It is clear that both $E\subset\Fc$ and $F\supset E$ imply $F\in\Fc$ by the
    definition of $\Fc$.

    Fix $E_1,E_2\in\Fc$ and take finite subsets $\Dc_1,\Dc_2\subset\Cc$ such
    that $\bigcap\Dc_1\subset E_1$ and $\bigcap\Dc_2\subset E_2$, respectively.
    By the basic set theory knowledge, we obtain $E_1\cap
    E_2\supset\bigcap(\Dc_1\cup\Dc_2)$ and notice that $\Dc_1\cup\Dc_2$ is a
    finite subset of $\Cc$, implying that $E_1\cap E_2\in\Fc$. Therefore, $\Fc$
    is a filter. It is clear by definition that $\Fc\supset\Cc$. \proved
\end{prop}

Sometimes, we will deal with not only filters but their subsets which acts like
a filter. Thanks to \Cref{prop:1.2.7} we can consider the following objects.

useenv defin [Filter base] {
    Let $X$ be a set. A \it{filter base} $\Bc$ is a nonempty collection of
    subsets of $X$ such that
    useenv enumerate [label=(\alph*)] {
        \item If $A,B\in\Bc$, then $A\cap B\in\Bc$.
        \item $\Bc$ satisfies FIP. In particular, $\emptyset\notin\Bc$.
    }
}

By \CreF{prop:1.2.7}, every filter base is contained in some filter.

After this definition, we will see why sequences can replaced into filters in
the general topology theories. This definition explains the way how filters are
transformed by functions.

\begin{defin}[Pushforward and pullback of filters] \label{defin:1.2.8}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ be nonempty sets and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a function. If $\Fc$
    is a filter in $X$, the filter
    \[
        f_*\Fc := \{E\supset f[F] : F\in\Fc\}
    \]
    is called a \it{pushforward of a filter $\Fc$}. If $\Bc$ is a filter base
    in $X$, then the filter base
    \[
        f_*\Bc := \{f[F] : F\in\Bc\}
    \]
    is called a \it{pushforward of a filter base $\Bc$}.

    If $f$ is surjective and $\Fc$ is a filter in $Y$, the filter
    \[
        f^*\Fc := \{E\supset f^{-1}[F] : F\in\Fc\}
    \]
    is called a \it{pullback of a filter $\Fc$}. If $\Bc$ is a filter base and
    the surjectivity of $f$ may drop, then the filter base
    \[
        f^*\Bc := \{f^{-1}[F] : F\in\Bc\}
    \]
    is called a \it{pullback of a filter base $\Bc$}.
\end{defin}

useenv exec {
    Prove that $f_*\Fc$ and $f^*\Gc$ defined in \Cref{defin:1.2.8} are really a
    filter, respectively.
}

The reader should check that \Cref{defin:1.2.8} makes sense (see Exercise
1.2.2).

\begin{remark}
    If the surjectivity is dropped, then $f^*\Fc$ might not be a filter if $\Fc$
    is a filter in $Y$.
\end{remark}

The pushforward of a filter has a remarkable property: every pushforward of
ultrafilters is again an ultrafilter. Notice that such property does not hold
for pullbacks in general.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:1.2.10}
    Let $X$, $Y$ be nonempty sets, $f:X\rightarrow Y$ a function, and $\Uc$ an ultrafilter
    in $X$. Then $f_*\Uc$ is an ultrafilter in $Y$.
    \proof
    Since $f_*\Uc$ is a filter, it suffices that it satisfies the sufficiency
    condition of \Cref{prop:1.2.4}. Let $A\subset Y$ be fixed.
    Since $\Uc$ is an ultrafilter, by \Cref{prop:1.2.4}, either
    $f^{-1}[A]\in\Uc$ or $X\setminus  f^{-1}[A]\in\Uc$ holds. As
    $X\setminus f^{-1}[A]=f^{-1}[Y\setminus A]$, we can assume that $f^{-1}[A]\in\Uc$.
    In this case, since $A\supset f[f^{-1}[A]]$ and $f[f^{-1}[A]]\in f_*\Uc$,
    we therefore have $A\in f_*\Uc$. The proof of this theorem is now completed
    by applying \Cref{prop:1.2.4}. \proved
\end{thm}

Now let $X$ be a topological space. Then we can define a convergence of filters.
Here is the definition.

\begin{defin}[Convergence of filters]
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A filter $\Fc$ in $X$ \it{converges} to
    $x\in X$ if every open neighborhood of $x$ belongs to $\Fc$. In this case,
    we write $\Fc\rightarrow x$.
\end{defin}

\begin{remark} \label{remark:1.2.12}
    One can ask about that if $x\in X$ is fixed then does there exist a filter
    converges to $x$. Let $\Nc$ be a collection of all open neighborhoods of
    $x$. Then clearly $\Nc$ satisfies FIP. Therefore, we can apply
    \Cref{prop:1.2.7} to take a filter $\Fc\supset\Nc$.
    Then by the definition of the convergence of filters, one can easily find
    that $\Fc\rightarrow x$.
\end{remark}

We are ready to see that why filters can be used instead of sequences in
arbitrary topological spaces.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:1.2.13}
    Let $X$, $Y$ be topological spaces. Then
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item For any nonempty set $A\subset X$, $x\in\cl A$ if and only if
        there is a filter $\Fc$ such that $A\in\Fc$ and $\Fc\rightarrow x$.
        \item Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a function. Then $f$ is continuous at $x\in X$ if
        and only if for every filter $\Fc$ in $X$ with $\Fc\rightarrow x$, $f_*\Fc\rightarrow f(x)$
        holds.
    \end{enumerate}
    \proof
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item If $x\in\cl A$, then $N\cap A\neq \emptyset$ for every open
        neighborhood $N$ of $x$. Now think
        \[
            \Cc := \{A\} \cup \{N : N \text{ is an open neighborhood of } x\}.
        \]
        Then notice that $\Cc$ satisfies FIP because every finite intersection
        of open sets is also open. Thus \Cref{prop:1.2.7} gives a filter $\Fc$
        that contains $\Cc$. Observe that by the definition of $\Cc$, $A\in\Fc$
        and $\Fc\rightarrow x$.

        Conversely, suppose that there is a point $x\in X$ and a filter $\Fc$ in
        $X$ such that $A\in\Fc$ and $\Fc\rightarrow x$. In order to show $x\in\cl A$, it
        suffices to show that $N\cap A$ is not empty for every open neighborhood
        $N$ of $x$. But notice that $\Fc\rightarrow x$ implies that every open
        neighborhood of $x$ belongs to $\Fc$. Since $A\in\Fc$, intersection of
        $N$ and $A$ cannot be empty by the definition of a filter. This proves
        $x\in\cl A$.

        \item Let $f$ be continuous at $x\in X$ and $\Fc$ a filter in $X$ that
        converges to $x$.
        Fix any open neighborhood $N$ of $f(x)$. Being continuous, there exists
        an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $f[U]\subset N$.
        Notice that $U\in\Fc$ because $\Fc$ converges to $x$.
        Then we have
        \[
            f[U]\in f_*\Fc \quad \Longrightarrow \quad N\in f_*\Fc,
        \]
        proving that $f_*\Fc\rightarrow f(x)$.

        Conversely, suppose that $f$ is not continuous at $x$.
        Then there exists an open set $W\ni f(x)$ such that no open
        neighborhood of $U$ of $x$ satisfies $f[U]\subset W$.
        Then define $\Fc$ by
        \[
            \Fc := \{E\subset X : E \supset U,\;U\text{ is an open neighborhood of }
            x\}.
        \]
        It is easy to check that $\Fc$ is a filter in $X$. Also by its
        definition, $\Fc$ converges to $x$.
        However, to be $f_*\Fc\rightarrow f(x)$, at least $W$ must lie in $f_*\Fc$. In
        other words, there must exist $E\in\Fc$ such that $f[E]\subset W$, but
        in this case, there must exist an open neighborhood $U$ of $x$ that is
        contained in $E$ and this gives $f[U]\subset W$, a contradiction.
        This proves that the filter $f_*\Fc$ does not converges to $f(x)$.
        \proved
    \end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

If $X$ is a metric space and $A\subset X$, then we know that $x\in\cl A$ if and
only if there exists a sequence $(x_n)_n$ in $A$ that converges to $x$ as
discussed in the introduction of this section. In \Cref{thm:1.2.13}, $A\in\Fc$
corresponds to the sentence $(x_n)_n\subset A$, and clearly $\Fc\to x$ means
$x_n\to x$ as $n\to\infty$.
In addition, statement \Cref{thm:1.2.13} (ii) is quite clear to explain whether
a function is continuous at $x$ by considering the assertion related to a
sequence.

Furthermore, note that on a Hausdorff space, every sequence converges at most
one point. This is also true for filters, and we can say more.

\begin{thm} \label{thm:1.2.14}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. Then $X$ is Hausdorff if and only
    if every filter converges at most one point. That is, if a filter $\Fc$ in
    $X$ converges in both $x\in X$ and $y\in X$, then $x=y$.
    \proof
    Let $X$ be Hausdorff and assume that there exists a filter $\Fc$ converges
    to different points $x$ and $y$. Take two disjoint open sets $U$ and $V$
    such that $x\in U$ and $y\in V$. Since $\Fc\to x$, $U\in\Fc$ is true. Same
    for $V\in\Fc$ since $y\in\Fc$. However, in this case, $\emptyset\in U\cap
    V\in\Fc$ must be true, which is a contradiction. Hence, there is no such
    filter if $X$ is Hausdorff.

    Conversely, if $X$ is not Hausdorff, then we can take two distict points $x$
    and $y$ such that there is no pair $(U,V)$ of open sets such that $x\in U$,
    $y\in V$, and $U\cap V=\emptyset$. Then define
    \[
        \Fc := \{E\supset F\cap G : F \in \Nc_x,\ G\in\Nc_y\}
    \]
    where $\Nc_x$, $\Nc_y$ is a collection of all open neighborhoods of $x$ and
    $y$, respectively. By the choice of $x$ and $y$, $\Fc$ does not have an
    emptyset as its element, so it is easy to show that $\Fc$ is a filter.
    Notice by the definition of $\Fc$ that $\Fc\to x$ and $\Fc\to y$.
    This proves the theorem. \proved
\end{thm}
