What is the definition of the \lq\lq area\rq\rq\ of some figures?
In the \it{real} kindergarten, the reader is taught about the area of a
rectangle is calculated by a multiple of the width and the height of the
rectangle. In the high school, the reader learn how to calculate the circle by
approximating areas of rectangles which fill the whole circle from inside.
Generally speaking, one can infer that every figure has an area and it can be
calculated with similar mannar.

In our intuition, a length ---an area in $\R$--- is translation invariant, and it
should be in our real life. Let us denote $\ell$ a length of sets in $\R$ and
assume that we can take a length from arbitrary sets in $\R$.
For instance, $\ell([a,b])=b-a$ and such definition comes from our intuition.
